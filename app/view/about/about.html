        <p>I'm a Seattle based web developer who specializes in JavaScript and component based architecture, informed by design knowledge
          and attention to detail. I'm passionate about improving society in useful ways through software development and inspired by the
          potential tech has to change lives all over the world. Some day I would like to start a nonprofit organization that improves the lives
          of the less fortunate by providing much needed services or information.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not obsessing over a tech project, I'm either climbing, running, or making something (most recently attempting abstract art).
        I draw inspiration from geometry and patterns found in nature and apply this to experiments in the form of drawing, jewelry design,
        acrylic painting, paper sculpture, lighting design and web design.
