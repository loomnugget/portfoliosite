      <div class="row">
        <h5>Goals</h5>
        <p>1. Use a calendar to visualize when mice of certain genotypes are going to be born.<br>
          2. Calculate expected number of usable offspring and breeding end dates based on user inputs.<br>
          3. Be able to create, update and remove project information.<br>
        </p><br>
        <h5>About</h5>
        <p>This research institute utilizes a SQL database to input information about mouse breeding cycles and genetic information.
          Breeders and lab managers need to be able to have this information readily available in meetings to relay to researchers planning projects.
          The projects are large and have many lines of mice (mice that have different genotypes).
          Each line of mice has a group of cages used to produce offspring (pups) that have desired genotypes.
          Each cage will have one or two females and a male, and will produce about 6 pups a month.
          They wanted to be able to have dropdown menus that allow them to select the appropriate project,
          line and cage and create and update models of each. They want initially for the create to only consist of a name,
          and have several feilds that are to be updated later as information is known to them.
          This updated information is used to calculate various properties that will be displayed when a line is selected.</p><br>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Going Forward</h5>
        <p>Eventually, it would be cool to have some more data visualizations other than a calendar to track and analyze various information.</p><br>

        <h5>About/Original Goals</h5>
        <p>I initially just wanted to make a quick rotating polyhedra and particle system to get some cool effects for front end development.
          One I started looking into it, I realized that not only was this challenging and required me to realearn a bunch of long-forgotten math,
          but that this sort of things is really exciting!I at first just tried to implement code from other people but
          it felt like I was cheating and I didn't understand where any of it was coming from and what was happening,
          so I couldn't really do much with it. Eventually this turned into a small 3D library project for me to practice javascript basics and functional programming.
          I was really interested and inspired by some chrome experments using only the canvas.
          I am totally mesmerized by particle systems and the magic of just using math equations to make beautiful visuals.
          I never expected to get this far into the math side of programming, but once I started learning about it,
          I got in deep and discovered its one of the coolest things ever. For most of my life,
          I sort of just thought math was boring but since I started getting more seriously into programming,
          I was blown away by the fact that math connects to the visual world so much!</p><br>

        <h5>Going Forward</h5>
        <p>I'd really like to continue on learning more about 3D math/programming.
          I'd like to do shading, back-face culling and some more physics effects in only javascript.
          I'm also interested in folding algorithms (origami!) and incorporating some of these into music visualizations.
          As a final touch to this project, I will probably add some interactivity layer to it,
          as in just being able to choose between polyhedra models. Doing anything beyond that from scratch is not
          something I will have time to do at the moment</p><br>

        <h5>About</h5>
        <p>This was a group project for a codefellows javascript class.
          I came up with the idea as a combo of pinterest/etsy that was intended to be more of a curated etsy that
          focused more on local artists and connecting specifically in local communities.
          As it stands right now, the curated part is left out, since that would have to be done manually,
          and it functions a simple social media site that focuses on artists. We used AWS S3 to upload and store photos,
          and Google and Facebook oAuth to have the option to sign up with pre-existing accounts.
          Users can create, update and delete a profile, galleries, and listings as well as upload and delete photos for each.</p><br>
        <h5>Going Forward</h5>
        <p>This was a lofty project for four people new at web development to finish in 5 days.
          In the future we would like to integrate the Stripe API to allow people to buy and sell,
          as well as being able to favorite items.</p><br>
